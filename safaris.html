The precise timing of the Migration is entirely dependent upon the rainfall patterns each year. When we arrive in Serengeti park, we shall proceed with en route game driving and game viewing towards Central Serengeti for the whole afternoon up to late evening, where dinner and overnight will be at Serengeti Heritage Tented Camp in Central Serengeti National Park.</p>
        
                <p><strong>DAY FOUR. Serengeti Park to Ngorongoro Crater:</strong> In day four, early morning after breakfast, you shall continue with game driving together with your private safari guide, looking for the herds across the plains. Apart from the migratory animals, you will also get to see lots of other animals like lions, cheetahs, leopards, and many more. Expect to be impressed by the natural beauty of Africa’s most famous park. After a picnic lunch in Serengeti Park, we drive for an exit game driving through the endless plains of Serengeti and heading to Ngorongoro Conservation Area for Dinner and overnight at Tortilis Tented Camp, while waiting for Crater game driving the coming day.</p>
        
                <p><strong>DAY FIVE. Ngorongoro Crater to Arusha:</strong> After waking up and having breakfast, we drive to Ngorongoro Conservation Area for game driving and game viewing into the Ngorongoro Crater. Ngorongoro is one of the famous world heritage sites in Tanzania, particularly in Africa and the World, with a unique natural wonder with the world's highest concentration of wildlife. When you arrive at the edge of Ngorongoro Crater, your eyes are welcomed by breathtaking views of the intact volcanic caldera and home to the highest density of Big game in Africa (Rhinos, Lions, Leopards, Buffalos, and Elephants). When you drive down into the Crater, it is an adventure in itself, and when you reach the Crater floor, you quickly find yourself among a large number of wildebeest, zebra, gazelle, and more than 500 bird species. The crater provides you with the best chance of seeing endangered black rhino, which with luck can be spotted in open grasslands (Read more about Ngorongoro Conservation Area). After a picnic lunch at Ngorongoro, we ascend the edges of the crater and drive back to Arusha Town for dinner and overnight at Planet Lodge, while waiting for your departure day.</p>
        
                <p><strong>DAY SIX. Departure to Home or Zanzibar:</strong> After breakfast, you will be picked up by your private safari guide from your lodge and driven to town for the last-minute shopping and repacking lunch. Transfer to the airport to catch your flight back home or a flight to Zanzibar.</p>
